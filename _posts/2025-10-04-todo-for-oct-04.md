To Do This Week Oct. 5, 2025
============================

I only have one podcast recorded so I need to schedule more interviews. I have a music stream event for the Ubuntu Summit coming up so I need to test that out ahead of time. I also need to record my band's performance video for that. Those are some of the main things I know I have to worry about, so I need to organize my thoughts to get those done this week and add anything else I think of in the process.
