# To-Do this week

Combining interviews, track recording walk-through's and lyric videos to promote my new remix album. My plan is still to try to increase YouTube watch hours.

## Reselling Business

- Pack orders and list more
- Therefore creating the self sustaining economy.

## Remix Album

Currently have a remix album Lorenzo's Remixes, Volume 2, out on the blocSonic Netlabel

### Podcast interviews

- Podcast is published every two weeks
- Interview remixers about how they made the song
- Promote that song and podcast interview over 2 weeks

### Lyric videos

- Create lyric videos for the songs
- Search for CC Videos to use on Vimeo, Archive or royalty free

### Track-walkthrough videos

- Record screencasts of songs I remixed
- Showing Ardour and Ubuntu Studio process we use

## Live Music Stream Clip Show

- Create video that is a collection of YouTube short clips from the live stream
