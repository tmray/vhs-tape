## Watch the Full Vlog: My Weekly To-Do for Album Launch & Podcast Growth

This week, I go over tasks for my creative ventures and planning for podcast interviews. I'm always constantly juggling art, tech, and the never-ending to-do list that comes with running my independent music career.

In my latest vlog, I decided to talk about what's consuming my time right now: the launch of [my new remix album for my band Lorenzo's Music](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2025/07/lorenzos-remixes-volume-2.html   ), and how it's going to tie into The Lorenzo's Music Podcast.

# The Remix Album: A Deep Dive into Creative Collaboration

Our new remix album is a project I'm incredibly excited about. It features reimaginings of our own songs, some remixed by me, and others by amazing Creative Commons musicians I've had the pleasure of connecting with through the podcast.

This project isn't just about new music; it's a collaboration in the independent scene and connecting and learning from new musicians.

# My Biggest Weekly Challenge: Podcast Interviews and Connecting Across Time Zones

I want to use the podcast to combine the creative process and marketing by interviewing the remixers and promoting each song we talk about on the show. So, this week, my main task revolves around scheduling podcast interviews with these remix artists.

It sounds simple, but coordinating with musicians from all over the world, across wildly different time zones, is actually the most time-consuming part of podcasting. It's tons of emails, waiting for replies, and calendar scheduling.

But here's why it's absolutely crucial:

# Learning from the Remixers: How These Interviews Make Me a Better Musician (and You Can Learn Too!)

Beyond just promoting the album, these interviews are a massive learning opportunity. Last year, when we released our first remix album, I struggled with the remixing process myself. I wanted to do things I didn't know how to do â€“ make the drums sound better, understand the production and sampling process.

Talking to [those](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2024/08/making-remix-slippery-friction-by-louis.html) [remixers](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2024/11/making-remix-slippery-friction-tryin.html) [made a](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2024/11/making-remix-rainy-day-friction.html) [huge difference](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2024/08/making-remix-friction-world-stringer.html). I learned so much that I felt confident enough to remix six songs on this new album, compared to just two last time!

My goal for these upcoming live interviews is to pick their brains, understand their techniques, and share those insights with you. Because if I can learn from them, so can you.

# The Promotion Strategy: Why This Benefits Everyone

This whole process is a win-win-win:

* Album Promotion: It's a fantastic way to promote the new remix album and focus on individual tracks.
* Artist Spotlight: It showcases the incredible remix artists who contributed.
* Podcast Content: It generates fascinating, actionable content for [The Lorenzo's Music Podcast](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/search/label/lorenzos-music-podcast), directly addressing the creative and technical questions many of us have about remixing and production.

It's about promotion, yes, but at its core, it's about staying connected with the musicians I meet a collaborative community.
