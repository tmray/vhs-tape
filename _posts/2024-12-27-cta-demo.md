# Demo: Download Box / CTA in VHS Style

Want to offer downloads, links, or special actions in your posts? Hereâ€™s how you can do it with a beautiful VHS-styled call-to-action box:

{% include cta-box.html
   title="Download My New Track"
   description="Get the high-quality WAV version of my latest single for free. Click below to start your download."
   button_text="Download Now"
   button_url="/assets/audio/my-track.wav"
%}

## How to Use This CTA Box

Just add this to any post or page:

```liquid
{% include cta-box.html
   title="Your CTA Title"
   description="Your description text."
   button_text="Button Label"
   button_url="https://your-link-or-download"
%}
```

- **title**: The main heading for your box
- **description**: Any supporting text you want
- **button_text**: The label for your button
- **button_url**: The link or download you want the button to go to

You can use this for downloads, external links, signups, or anything you want to highlight!
