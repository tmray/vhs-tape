# Essential Gear for the Analog Sound

Building the right setup for analog recording is crucial. Here's the gear I rely on to achieve that warm, vintage sound that's so hard to replicate digitally.

## Microphones

**Neumann U87**: My go-to vocal microphone. It has that classic sound that's been used on countless hit records. The key is finding the right distance and angle for each singer.

**Shure SM57**: The workhorse of the studio. Great for guitars, drums, and even vocals in a pinch. It's built like a tank and sounds great on everything.

## Preamps

**Neve 1073**: The holy grail of preamps. It adds that magical warmth and character that makes everything sound better. Expensive, but worth every penny.

**Universal Audio LA-2A**: My favorite compressor. It's smooth, musical, and adds that perfect amount of glue to a mix.

## Effects

**Lexicon 224**: For reverb. Digital, but it has that classic sound that's been used on countless records.

**Echoplex EP-3**: For delay. The tape delay adds warmth and character that digital delays just can't match.

## The VHS Connection

All of this gear contributes to that VHS aesthetic in my music. The warmth, the character, the imperfections - they all work together to create something that feels alive and human.

## What's Next

I'm always on the lookout for new gear that can add character to my recordings. The goal is never perfection - it's about finding tools that help me create music that feels real and emotional.

The right gear is important, but it's how you use it that really matters.
