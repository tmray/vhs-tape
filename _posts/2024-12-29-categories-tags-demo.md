# Categories and Tags System Demo

Welcome to the new categories and tags system! This post demonstrates how you can organize your content with categories and multiple tags.

## How Categories Work

Categories are like the main folders for your content. Each post can have one category. For example:
- **Music**: Posts about your music, tracks, albums
- **Tutorials**: How-to guides and technical posts
- **Vlogs**: Video content and behind-the-scenes
- **Gear**: Equipment reviews and setup posts

## How Tags Work

Tags are more specific labels that help readers find related content. You can add multiple tags to each post:
- **demo**: Example posts showing features
- **categories**: Posts about the category system
- **tags**: Posts about the tagging system
- **organization**: Content organization tips
- **jekyll**: Technical Jekyll-related content

## Example Post Structure

Here's how you would structure a post about your latest track:

## Navigation

You can now browse content by:

- **Tags**: Visit `/tags.html` to see all tags

- **Individual Tag Pages**: Click on any tag to see all posts with that tag

## Benefits

This system helps readers:
- Find content they're interested in
- Discover related posts
- Navigate your site more easily
- Understand the type of content you create

The categories and tags are displayed on each post and in the post listings, making it easy to see what each post is about at a glance.
