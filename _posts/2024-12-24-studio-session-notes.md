# Studio Session Notes: Finding the Perfect Sound

Today's studio session was all about capturing that warm, analog feel that's so hard to replicate digitally. I spent hours tweaking microphone positions, adjusting preamp settings, and experimenting with different room placements.

## The Setup

I started with a vintage Neumann U87 through a Neve 1073 preamp - a classic combination that never fails to deliver. The key was finding the sweet spot where the microphone could capture both the clarity and the warmth I was looking for.

## The Challenge

The biggest challenge was maintaining that VHS aesthetic in the recording process itself. I wanted the music to feel like it was being played through an old tape deck, with all the character and imperfections that make analog recordings so special.

## The Breakthrough

After several hours of experimentation, I found that recording at a slightly lower level and then boosting in post-production gave me exactly the sound I was looking for. The subtle compression and harmonic distortion created that warm, nostalgic feel I was chasing.

## What's Next

I'm planning to release a full EP recorded using these techniques. Each track will be mixed to feel like it's playing on an old VHS tape, complete with subtle tape hiss and warm saturation.

Stay tuned for the first single, coming soon!
