I'm Tom Ray, a musician and creator who documents the process of building, launching, and sustaining independent projects. This site is my home base for sharing what I'm making, what I'm learning, and the systems I use to keep the work moving.

Most posts focus on the practical side of creativity: planning releases, setting up sites, running experiments, and refining the workflows that support the art. If you're into building in public, you are in the right place.

**Projects I build and maintain:**

- [Lorenzo's Music](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com) - band website and releases
- [HomeMade Cartoons](https://www.homemadecartoons.com) - comics, books, and ongoing stories
- [The Pop Culture Roadshow](https://www.thepopcultureroadshow.com) - vintage reselling business

If you want the day-to-day process, head to the [blog](/posts/) and browse by [categories](/categories/) or [tags](/tags/).
